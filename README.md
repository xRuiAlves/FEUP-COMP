## Project topic

The topic of this project is to create a compiler for a reduced subset of the Java language, nicknamed Java--. This compiler will parse the code, providing lexical analysis (using JavaCC), semantic analysis and code optimizations, outputting the code to a Jasmin file, which can later on be compiled to Java bytecodes using the jasmin binaries.
